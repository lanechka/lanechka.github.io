<h1>Crocheted Comforts for Soldiers</h1>

<p>Crochet uses a single needle with a hook at the end to manipulate stitches. It produces a fabric that is denser than knitting and also much less flexible. These days, crochet has a bad reputation and inevitably brings to mind doilies and old-fashioned grandmothers. However, when it was first documented in the nineteenth century, it was often used to mimic both bobbin and needle lace. Of course, it could also be put to far more utilitarian uses, and while knitted socks from the Great War are more well-known than their crocheted counterparts, patterns for crocheted socks and other soldiers’ accessories appeared throughout the war.</p>

<p>In France, crochet was particularly popular at the beginning of the war. Among the instructions for gloves, mittens, and balaclavas, the newspaper <em>Le Temps</em> printed a pattern for a crochet sock in November 1914. Later, another pattern appeared in the booklet <em>La Femme et la Guerre</em> (Woman and War). In September 1915, <em>Les Annales politiques et littéraires</em> published a pattern for “crocheted trench socks.” Mrs Brémont, who sent the pattern, was kind enough to enclose a sample sock as well; it was, the editor wrote, “very practical and soldiers have already benefited from them” despite the fact that, “at first sight, the general aspect [of the sock] is unconvincing.”</p>

<p>Crocheted socks also experienced a measure of popularity in other countries. According to the <em>Leader</em> of Melbourne, Australia, "Crocheted socks for our soldiers at the front are much quicker and easier to make than knitted ones; they are also more durable." Not to mention that if they were washed "in tepid (soapy) water, dried, and pressed before wearing," they became "soft and extremely comfortable."</p>

<p>While women may have eagerly cast themselves into the crochet fray, the garments that they produced may have been less than ideal. Regarding the desirability of "crochetted articles" for the war effort, a branch of the American Red Cross informed volunteers that "The war authorities in France prefer not to have them. They are bulky, and seldom warm enough." Other aid organisations similarly preferred knitting because it produced items that were "light and elastic."
Perhaps for this reason, crocheters began to focus on the production of hospital socks, also called bed socks, for convalescent soldiers. Bulkiness, inelasticity, and lack of warmth presented less of a problem for relatively immobile men housed in a clean indoor environment. As one newspaper assured crafters, in such a setting a crocheted sock "would be found very comfortable in wear, as it keeps the bandages in place without any pressure."</p>

<p>The use of crocheted socks in hospitals is perhaps not surprising; medical facilities accepted a variety of socks, including tube socks and spiral socks in both crochet and knitting. Yet whenever crochet attempted to claim a place alongside knitting as an equal, rather than inferior, craft it met firm resistance. As M.H. Mackay wrote in a letter to the Bendigo Advertiser, even hospital socks ought to be knitted because they “take less wool than crocheted ones, and wash better.” The former is certainly true; given the density of crochet stitches and the ways in which the yarn must be twisted to form them, the latter claim is also plausible.</p>

<p>Few crochet patterns for any soldiers’ comforts appeared in German-language media during the war. Donation lists from the early months of the war contain few crocheted items in general, none of them socks. Germany’s acute wartime wool shortage may explain the preference for knitting. The hospital slippers pictured below are an exception; it may be relevant that the pattern was published in 1914, when wool was still relatively readily available.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the exacting standards for combat socks meant that knitting predominated in all combatant countries. As a French newspaper eventually admitted, “We can’t crochet everything; socks in particular are deplorable.”</p>
