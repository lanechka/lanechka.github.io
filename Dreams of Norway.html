			<h2> Shawl for the 17th of May</a></h2>
			<p>This shawl was designed for Norway’s Constitution Day (May 17). It’s a top-down Faroese-style with shoulder shaping and gusset, which make it easy to wear as it sits on your shoulders without falling off. The body of the shawl is a simple diamond pattern that’s easy to memorize while the border features Estonian lilies with more than 850 nupps. The shawl is then finished with a crochet chain edging.</p>

			<h2>Westfold Wheat</a></h2>				
			<p>Westfold Wheat is a simple Estonian-style wrap knitted from the bottom up and grafted at the center. The border features nupps and gathered stitches and requires some attention, but the body of the shawl is easy to memorize and quick to knit. It’s easy to adjust both the width and length of this shawl by casting on more/fewer sts and working more/fewer repeats of the main pattern.</p>

			<p>Troldhaugen is a triangular top-down shawl with beads, nupps, and a true lace edging. It’s named for Edvard Grieg’s piano piece “Wedding Day at Troldhaugen” from Lyric Pieces. In white it would make a lovely wedding shawl, while stronger colours give it more dramatic flair.</p>
