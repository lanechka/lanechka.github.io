			<h2> Should Prince William Learn to Knit?</a></h2>
			<p>The answer, of course, is yes! Prince William should absolutely learn to knit. He would be following in the hallowed footsteps of his ancestors -- not just his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, but also his great-granduncles Edward VIII and the first Duke of Kent. Knitting would also complement his focus on environmental and mental health charities.

			<h2> How to Knit a Perfect Sock for a Soldier</a></h2>
			<p>Between 1914 to 1918, women knitted millions of socks for soldiers at the front. The task of ensuring the quality of these socks fell to organizations such as the Red Cross. To guarantee a “perfect standard of sock for our boys,” they faced more challenges than you might realize.</p>

			<h2> Germany’s “Knitting Battalions” of the Great War</a></h2>
			<p>During World War I, knitters from Allied nations produced millions of socks, caps, scarves, and sweaters for military use. American Red Cross volunteers knitted nearly 24 million garments; Australian knitters sent 1.3 million pairs of socks to the front. However, the efforts of German and Austrian knitters are less well-known. This article draws on German-language patterns, newspapers, government reports, and wartime poetry in order to shed light on their contributions.</p>

			<h2>Not Your Great-Grandmother's Knitting</a></h2>
			<p>Two assumptions dominate the modern understanding of knitting during World War I: firstly, that knitting was the exclusive purview of women and girls; and secondly, that socks were knitted one at a time by hand. In fact, the need for socks was so great that two-at-a-time sock techniques, crochet, knitting machines, and men were drafted into service to supply them.
