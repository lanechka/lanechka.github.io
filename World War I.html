				<h2>  How Dandelions Saved Norway in the Great War</a></h2>
				<p>Although Norway zealously guarded its neutrality during World War I, the conflict could not be kept entirely at bay. The war cut off Norway from the maritime trade that had sustained it for centuries and the country descended into a period known as dyrtiden -- literally, “the expensive time,” one hallmark of which was food rationing. Enter the dandelion: a free, abundant source of nutrition. </p>

			<h2>  Germany's Dragon Riders of the Great War</a></h2>
			<p>Before the late nineteenth century, dragons were considered unsuitable for use in warfare for a variety of (fairly obvious) reasons. However, during and after the wars of German unification in the 19th century, European militaries began to reconsider their utility. In Germany, a government breeding program led to the development of the Fliegerwurm. With a wingspan of 9 meters, the ability to spew flame, and high degree of intelligence and loyalty, the Fliegerwurm proved to be a formidable weapon during World War I.</p>

				<h2>  The Hidden History of Norway's POW Camps in WWI</a></h2>
				<p>In one of the lesser-known episodes of Norwegian WWI history, 2000 prisoners of war from Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary were sent to Norway to regain their health at various hotels and sanatoriums in the final years of the conflict. This article examines the experiences of wounded German soldiers who stayed at Løken Hotel in 1917 and 1918.</p>

			<h2>  What did the War Sound Like?</a></h2>
			<p>Given the lack of audio recordings from the battlefield, we can’t really know the answer to that question. But in correspondence from the front, German soldiers did their best to transcribe the “hellish music” of war for their families at home.</p>

			<h2> Germany’s “Knitting Battalions” of the Great War</a></h2>
			<p>During World War I, knitters from Allied nations produced millions of socks, caps, scarves, and sweaters for military use. American Red Cross volunteers knitted nearly 24 million garments; Australian knitters sent 1.3 million pairs of socks to the front. However, the efforts of German and Austrian knitters are less well-known. This article draws on German-language patterns, newspapers, government reports, and wartime poetry in order to shed light on their contributions.</p>

			<h2>The Curious Case of the Crucified Canadian</a></h2>
			<p>During World War I, the story of a Canadian soldier crucified by the Germans circulated both among troops and civilians. It started with a single sentence but soon grew with the telling. Here’s a closer look at how it started and what it became.</p>

			<h2> A World Without Rubber</a></h2>

			<h2> Who was the First Soldier from Hawaii to Die in WWI?</a></h2>
			<p>Just over one hundred men from the Territory of Hawaii died while serving in the military during the war. Only a small minority were killed in action — seven while fighting with US forces and approximately twenty with British Empire troops. Of these men, one might well ask: Who was the first? Whom ought we to recognise as the first soldier from Hawaii to die in combat in the Great War? The answer is less straightforward than you might think.</p>

			<h2> How to Knit a Perfect Sock for a Soldier</a></h2>
			<p>Between 1914 to 1918, women knitted millions of socks for soldiers at the front. The task of ensuring the quality of these socks fell to organizations such as the Red Cross. To guarantee a “perfect standard of sock for our boys,” they faced more challenges than you might realize.</p>

				<h2>  The Rise & Fall of Zeppelin L20</a></h2>
				<p>The German Zeppelin L20 crashed in a fjord near Stavanger in May 1916. Known as the Raider of Loughborough for its attacks on that city in England, it was received quite differently in neutral Norway. L20 fascinated the local population, and the final fate of the crew and the airship itself were well-documented in Norwegian newspapers at the time. </p>
