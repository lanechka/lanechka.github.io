			<h2>  What did the War Sound Like?</a></h2>
			<p>Given the lack of audio recordings from the battlefield, we can’t really know the answer to that question. But in correspondence from the front, German soldiers did their best to transcribe the “hellish music” of war for their families at home.</p>

			<h2>The Curious Case of the Crucified Canadian</a></h2>
			<p>During World War I, the story of a Canadian soldier crucified by the Germans circulated both among troops and civilians. It started with a single sentence but soon grew with the telling. Here’s a closer look at how it started and what it became.</p>

			<h2> Who was the First Soldier from Hawaii to Die in WWI?</a></h2>
			<p>Just over one hundred men from the Territory of Hawaii died while serving in the military during the war. Only a small minority were killed in action — seven while fighting with US forces and approximately twenty with British Empire troops. Of these men, one might well ask: Who was the first? Whom ought we to recognise as the first soldier from Hawaii to die in combat in the Great War? The answer is less straightforward than you might think.</p>

			<h2> Germany’s “Knitting Battalions” of the Great War</a></h2>
			<p>During World War I, knitters from Allied nations produced millions of socks, caps, scarves, and sweaters for military use. American Red Cross volunteers knitted nearly 24 million garments; Australian knitters sent 1.3 million pairs of socks to the front. However, the efforts of German and Austrian knitters are less well-known. This article draws on German-language patterns, newspapers, government reports, and wartime poetry in order to shed light on their contributions.</p>

			<h2> How to Knit a Perfect Sock for a Soldier</a></h2>
			<p>Between 1914 to 1918, women knitted millions of socks for soldiers at the front. The task of ensuring the quality of these socks fell to organizations such as the Red Cross. To guarantee a “perfect standard of sock for our boys,” they faced more challenges than you might realize.</p>
