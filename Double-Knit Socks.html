<h1>WWI Double-Knitted Socks from Australia</h1>

<p>Twenty-first century knitters talk about "second sock syndrome," which refers to the lack of will to knit a second sock to complete the pair. While this particular terminology likely did not exist a century ago, wartime knitters were quite familiar with the problem. Back then, the solution came in the form of "Siamese socks"- the process of knitting two socks at once on the same set of needles.</p>

<p>This method, nowadays known as double-knitting, was said to come from Australia. Supposedly, Australian women finished 50 000 pairs of socks a month using this method. However, as the New York Sun conceded, "it is something to test the skill of the superknitters to narrow and knit two heels at the same time."</p>


<p>The phenomenon traveled to the farthest corners of empire. The <em>Matura Ensign</em> of New Zealand reprinted the article verbatim from the American papers, even preserving the description of Australia as "the land of queer things." The same article also appeared in the Australian press, though in a modified form: it made no mention of the technique's so-called Australian origin and most certainly did not refer to the country as queer.</p>

<p>How does one go about knitting "Siamese socks"?</p>

<p><em>Two balls of yarn are used, one for each sock. The thread of one runs over the right forefinger. Cast on double the usual number of stitches, first of one thread and then the other. Then knit one and purl the other. That's all there is to it. Easy enough!</em></p>

<p><em>â€¦there's fascination in working it out and great satisfaction to find one sock growing inside the other. The "right sides" will be together on the inside. The outside will show the "wrong side." Get it?</em></p>

<p>In case those instructions weren't "easy enough" and you didn't "get it," this video may help:</p>

<p>My conversations with Australian knitters suggest that women there did not historically knit their stockings two at a time. In fact, the origins of the technique are certainly older than the Great War and likely not of Australian origin; for example, Anna Makarovna in Tolstoy's novel War and Peace knits socks in this way.</p>
