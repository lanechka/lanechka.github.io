		<h1>Reviews of Graphic Novels</h1>
		<p> I review graphic novels (comics) with a focus on World War I and Norwegian authors.</p>
		<p>Many of these books were originally written in French or Norwegian. English translations are not always available.</p>
		<p> All my reviews are written in English.</p>

			<h2> Magnus Carlsen og Sjakkmorderen</a></h2>
			<p>In this infinitely silly and action-filled story, a serial killer has divided Oslo into a chess board and presents world champion Magnus Carlsen with chess riddles that he must solve in order to determine the location of the next murder.</p>
			<p>One of the co-authors called this review “interesting and reflective” and especially liked my suggestion that the book be turned into a movie starring Magnus Carlsen himself!</p>
